/**
 * Scala API: Tool for deleting events and/or snapshots for a given list of `persistenceIds` without using persistent
 * actors.
 *
 * When running an operation with `EventSourcedCleanup` that deletes all events for a persistence id, the actor with
 * that persistence id must not be running! If the actor is restarted it would in that case be recovered to the wrong
 * state since the stored events have been deleted. Delete events before snapshot can still be used while the actor is
 * running.
 *
 * If `resetSequenceNumber` is `true` then the creating entity with the same `persistenceId` will start from 0.
 * Otherwise it will continue from the latest highest used sequence number.
 *
 * WARNING: reusing the same `persistenceId` after resetting the sequence number should be avoided, since it might be
 * confusing to reuse the same sequence number for new events.
 *
 * When a list of `persistenceIds` are given they are deleted sequentially in the order of the list. It's possible to
 * parallelize the deletes by running several cleanup operations at the same time operating on different sets of
 * `persistenceIds`.
