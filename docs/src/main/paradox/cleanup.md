## Event Sourced cleanup tool

@@@ warning

When running any operation with `EventSourcedCleanup` for a persistence id, the actor with that persistence id must
not be running!

If possible, it is best to keep all events in an event sourced system. That way new @ref[Projections](projection.md)
can be re-built.

In some cases keeping all events is not possible or must be removed for regulatory reasons, such as compliance with
GDPR. `EventSourcedBehavior`s can automatically snapshot state and delete events as described in the
@extref:[Akka docs](akka:typed/persistence-snapshot.html#snapshot-deletion). Snapshotting is useful even if events
aren't deleted as it speeds up recovery.

Deleting all events immediately when an entity has reached its terminal deleted state would have the consequence that
Projections might not have consumed all previous events yet and will not be notified of the deleted event. Instead, it's
recommended to emit a final deleted event and store the fact that the entity is deleted separately via a Projection.
Then a background task can clean up the events and snapshots for the deleted entities by using the
@apidoc[EventSourcedCleanup] tool. The entity itself knows about the terminal state from the deleted event and should
not emit further events after that and typically stop itself if it receives more commands.

@apidoc[EventSourcedCleanup] operations include:

* Delete all events and snapshots for one or many persistence ids
* Delete all events for one or many persistence ids
* Delete all snapshots for one or many persistence ids
* Delete events before snapshot for one or many persistence ids

The cleanup tool can be combined with the @ref[query plugin](./query.md) which has a query to get all persistence ids.

## Durable State cleanup tool

@@@ warning

When running any operation with `DurableStateCleanup` for a persistence id, the actor with that persistence id must
not be running!

@apidoc[DurableStateCleanup] operations include:

* Delete state for one or many persistence ids

The cleanup tool can be combined with the @ref[query plugin](./query.md) which has a query to get all persistence ids.
