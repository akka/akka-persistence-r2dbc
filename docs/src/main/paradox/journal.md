# Journal plugin

The journal plugin enables storing and loading events for
@extref:[event sourced persistent actors](akka:typed/persistence.html).

## Schema

The `event_journal` table and `event_journal_slice_idx` index need to be created in the configured database, see schema
definition in @ref:[Creating the schema](getting-started.md#schema).

The `event_journal_slice_idx` index is only needed if the slice based @ref:[queries](query.md) are used.

## Configuration

To enable the journal plugin to be used by default, add the following line to your Akka `application.conf`:

```
akka.persistence.journal.plugin = "akka.persistence.r2dbc.journal"
```

It can also be enabled with the `journalPluginId` for a specific `EventSourcedBehavior` and multiple plugin
configurations are supported.

See also @ref:[Connection configuration](connection-config.md).

### Reference configuration

The following can be overridden in your `application.conf` for the journal specific settings:

@@snip [reference.conf](/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf) {#journal-settings}

## Deletes

The journal supports deletes through hard deletes, which means the journal entries are actually deleted from the
database. There is no materialized view with a copy of the event so make sure to not delete events too early if they are
used from projections or queries.

For each persistent id one tombstone record is kept in the event journal when all events of a persistence id have been
deleted. The reason for the tombstone record is to keep track of the latest sequence number so that subsequent events
don't reuse the same sequence numbers that have been deleted.

See the @ref[EventSourcedCleanup tool](cleanup.md#event-sourced-cleanup-tool) for more information about how to delete
events, snapshots and tombstone records.
